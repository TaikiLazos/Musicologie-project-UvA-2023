# Musicologie-project-UvA-2023
Welcome to my github repository where you can find my work during the course computational musicology at the Universiteit van Amsterdam. The course is given by Dr. Ashley Burgoyne.

## Description about my corpus
For this course we analyze a playlist of our personal Spotify account. I personally don't have a Spotify account and I did not want to analyze a generic playlist made by Spotify I decided to use my brother's playlist who has a great taste in music.

The playlist is named after a Japanese word, "切ない系" (Setsunai-kei) meaning "melancholic" or "wistful" in English. The 57-song playlist is a collection of songs that convey bittersweet sentiments through sweet vocals assisted by soft and warm instrumentals. The playlist is primarily composed of songs sung in Japanese or Korean but also includes English songs. Despite the difference in language amongst the songs included, they share the similarity in the melodies of the songs, often having sweet and charming rings. The vocals of the songs are also one of the main elements that make the playlist truly melancholic, as if the artists are whispering to the heart of the listener. 

It is expected that the playlist will have similarities with other J-pop playlists, K-pop playlists and sad-love songs playlists. ... 

The song that represents the playlist the best would be the 1999-Hit-song "First love" by Hikaru Utada. The song has Utada's sweet vocals backed with sad instumentals and melancholic lyrics, thereby fitting the main theme of the playlist. 

In contrast, the R&B/Soul song, "Nothing even Matters" by Mrs. Lauryn Hill and D'angelo would be the song least fitting from the overall vibe of the playlist. The song having jazzy instumental with warm vocals, would be an example of an atypical song in the playlist.
